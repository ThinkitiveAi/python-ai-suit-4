# customehr

A clean, focused healthcare user management system with role-based authentication and REST API endpoints.


## üè• Healthcare User Management System

This application provides a streamlined healthcare user management system with role-based access control for patients, healthcare providers, and administrative staff. Built with Django and Django REST Framework, it offers a clean, maintainable codebase focused on essential healthcare functionality.

### üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

#### **User Types & Permissions**

1. **Staff Users** (`user_type: "staff"`)
   - Full administrative access
   - Can manage all users, patients, and clinicians
   - Can create, read, update, delete all records
   - Access to admin dashboard

2. **Provider Users** (`user_type: "provider"`)
   - Healthcare professionals (Physicians, Nurses, Surgical Assistants)
   - Can view all patient records (read-only)
   - Linked to ClinicianUser model
   - Cannot modify patient data

3. **Patient Users** (`user_type: "patient"`)
   - Can only access their own patient record
   - Read-only access to personal data
   - Linked to Patient model
   - Secure data isolation

### üìä Data Models

#### **User Model** (`customehr/users/models.py`)
- **Base User**: Email-based authentication with role management
- **Fields**: name, email, password, contactnumber, role, status, user_type
- **Links**: linked_patient, linked_clinician (foreign keys)

#### **ClinicianUser Model**
- **Roles**: Physicians, Nurses, Surgical Assistants
- **Fields**: firstname, lastname, role, emailid, contactnumber, npi, location, language, supervising_clinician
- **Supervision Levels**: None, Senior Clinician, Chief Clinician

#### **Patient Model**
- **Demographics**: first_name, middle_name, last_name, preferred_name, date_of_birth
- **Identity**: sex, gender_identity, ethnicity, race, language
- **Contact**: email, phone_number
- **Address**: address_line1, address_line2, city, state, zip_code

#### **Appointment Models**
- **AppointmentSlot**: Available time slots for providers
- **Appointment**: Booked appointments with patients and providers

### üîê Authentication System

#### **JWT Authentication**
- **Login Endpoint**: `POST /api/login/`
- **Token Lifetime**: Access (1 hour), Refresh (1 day)
- **Security**: Bearer token authentication

#### **API Authentication Flow**
```bash
# 1. Login to get JWT tokens
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "password"}'

# 2. Use access token for API calls
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/patients/
```

### üåê API Endpoints

- `GET /api/appointments/{id}/` - Get appointment details
- `PUT /api/appointments/{id}/` - Update appointment
- `DELETE /api/appointments/{id}/` - Cancel appointment

- `GET /api/appointments/available_slots/?provider_id={id}` - Get available slots for provider

### üîí Permission System

#### **Custom Permission Classes**
- `IsStaff` - Staff users only
- `IsProviderOrStaff` - Providers and staff
- `IsPatientOrProviderOrStaff` - All authenticated users

#### **Data Access Rules**
- **Patients**: Can only see their own record
- **Providers**: Can see all patient records (read-only)
- **Staff**: Can access and modify all data

### üöÄ Quick Start

#### **1. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements/local.txt
```

#### **2. Run Migrations**
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

#### **3. Create Superuser**
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

#### **4. Start Development Server**
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

#### **5. Setup Test Data**
1. Access admin dashboard: `http://localhost:8000/admin/`
2. Create Patient records
3. Create ClinicianUser records
4. Create User accounts with appropriate `user_type` and links

#### **6. Test API Endpoints**
```bash
# Test login

- Implement rate limiting
- Set up proper CORS policies

#### **Performance**
- Add database indexing
- Implement caching
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Monitor API usage

#### **Compliance**

## Settings

Moved to [settings](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-getting-started/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

      $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    $ mypy customehr

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

    $ coverage run -m pytest
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

#### Running tests with pytest

    $ pytest

### Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation

Moved to [Live reloading and SASS compilation](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-local-development/developing-locally.html#using-webpack-or-gulp).

### Celery

This app comes with Celery.

To run a celery worker:

```bash
cd customehr
celery -A config.celery_app worker -l info
```

Please note: For Celery's import magic to work, it is important _where_ the celery commands are run. If you are in the same folder with _manage.py_, you should be right.

To run [periodic tasks](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/periodic-tasks.html), you'll need to start the celery beat scheduler service. You can start it as a standalone process:

```bash
cd customehr
celery -A config.celery_app beat
```

or you can embed the beat service inside a worker with the `-B` option (not recommended for production use):

```bash
cd customehr
celery -A config.celery_app worker -B -l info
```

### Email Server

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. For that reason local SMTP server [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) with a web interface is available as docker container.

Container mailpit will start automatically when you will run all docker containers.
Please check [cookiecutter-django Docker documentation](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-local-development/developing-locally-docker.html) for more details how to start all containers.

With Mailpit running, to view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8025`

## Deployment

The following details how to deploy this application.
